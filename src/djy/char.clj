(ns ^{:doc "A library of character-related utility functions for Clojure.
  
        Note: There are several functions in this library that may collide with other
        namespaces. Recommended usage is:
            (ns your.namespace
              (:require [djy.char :as char :refer (...)]))

        Many of these functions are polymorphic in that they can accept as an argument
        either a character, an integer representing a Unicode code point, or a string.
        If the argument is a string, the function uses the Unicode code point found at
        index 0 of the string, and the rest of the string (if the string happens to be 
        longer than one Unicode code point) is ignored, e.g.:

            (code-point-of '\ud800\udc00') ;=> 65536
            (code-point-of 'hello')        ;=> 104 (the code point of 'h')
            [imagine that the single quotes above are double quotes]

        When dealing with supplementary Unicode characters with code points higher than 
        U+FFFF, the character must be represented either as a String (e.g. '\ud800\udc00')
        or as a code point (e.g. 65536). This is due to the inherent limitations of 16-
        bit Java characters and the fact that Clojure character literals are built on top
        of them.

        Glossary:

        * Code Point: any value in the Unicode codespace; that is, the range of integers
             from 0 to 10FFFF (in decimal: 1114111). Not all code points are assigned to 
             encoded characters.
        * Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP): Unicode characters in the range 0000-FFFF.
        * Supplementary characters: Unicode characters with code points > FFFF. Java
              represents these characters as a string containing two 16-bit characters,
              a high-surrogate and a low-surrogate (in that order).
        * High-surrogates: characters in the range D800-DBFF
        * Low-surrogates: characters in the range DC00-DFFF
        * ASCII: characters in the range 0000-007F (0-127)
        * Latin-1: characters in the range 0080-00FF (0-255)"
